When you're travelling as a wheelchair user there's this very frustrating assumption that you will never be travelling without someone who's job (either paid or unpaid) it is to help with with travelling, so we're always supposed to be with someone. Then when we are with someone it's never thought of that we might be travelling with friends who will help when they can but aren't solely there to help the wheelchair user.<!--more-->

Photograph shows my wheelchair loaded up as if I'm heading away on a trip. The wheelchair is a matt metallic blue Quickie Helium, with black upholstery. There is a black and blue shoulder bag that has been modified to hang under the seat. On the back of the wheelchair there is a black backpack, attached through the rear cross bar. Above the backpack there are a pair of sandals and a blue sleeve containing a water bottle.
