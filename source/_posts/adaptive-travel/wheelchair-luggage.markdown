One of the most frustrating things about travelling is what to do with your luggage. It feels like wheelchair designers assume that you will never need to carry more than a small bag and luggage designers are only designing for the non-disabled market. <!--more-->

A lot of people go for a single large backpack with everything in hooked over their push handles on the back of their chair. This is a great solution for powerchairs as they have the weight and centre of gravity to cope with weight being put onto the back of the chair. But is less good for self propelled chairs as the weight on the back coupled with quite high centre of gravity makes you much more likely to tip over backwards. In the case of more sporty self propelled chairs it will cause them to tip over imediately after you transfter out of your chair, and make transfering into your chair difficult to impossible with the bag attached. There is also security to consider, given the bag is attached to your chair and not to you you are unlikely to feel someone trying to open the bag, so if you do carry a bag in this way I would not recomend putting anything worth stealing in you bag.

The best place I've found to carry a bag that contains the things I would be worried about someone attempting to steal is slung under my wheelchair, if you have a folding chair is is possible to sling a small bag between the back of your legs and the folding mechenism. With a ridged wheelchair there is space all the way back to the axel bar of your chair, so with front and back slings you can attach a quite a large bag. Unfortunatly this only really works on self propelled chair, as most power chairs tend to have their battiers and motor under their seat so don't have the space to accomdate a bag. Having said that some have as much space as a folding self propelled chair so a small bag might be possible.

Finally I have a set of fold down forks that I can add to the uprights of the foot place on my wheelchair, which will allow me to add another bag infront of my legs. For my make of wheelchair they are called the Quickie Caddy<%- npr %> (Sunrise Part Number: 902350), but other manfacturers make simlar devices for their wheelchairs as well. While these seemed like a great idea when I bought them they turned out not to be so useful, as all you have a two thin sticks jutting out from the front of your chair. A soft bag will sag and normally just fall off if you have to stop quickly or go down a slope, using a hard bag and a bungy cord helps, but leads to the case pressing against your legs or knees which just lead to pressure sores for me. So these have been mostly consigned to the interesting parts box at home, I still get them out from time to time when I need to carry the hard case with my DJ equipment in, which I only carry for really short durations so isn't an issue. But I wouldn't like to try and travel for a long time with luggage attached in this way.

A lot of it will depend on what type of wheelchair you have as the different types of wheelchairs have different spaces that allow of the attachment of luggage. As I said previously powerchairs are the easiest to attach luggage to, their high weight and low centre of gravity means it quite easy to sling a normal walking backpack on the back and off you go. Their wheels tend to be smaller and out of the way so it's also easy to keep straps from the bag from getting tangled in the wheels.

## My soultion for luggage

Personally I have three main bags that get added to my wheelchair depending on how far I'm travelling and how long I'm going to be away for. 

### Everyday Bag

This is the bag that goes everywhere with me, it's fairly small and contains just my essential stuff, it also needs to be light because it spends a fair amount of time sat on my lap. Being light also helps on the occastions that I'm walking as it's not possible for me to walk and carry any significant weight.

### Dayout Bag

My dayout bag is an EastPak Gibbs<%- ncpr %>, it is slung underath my seat and has been hacked with the inclusion two aluminum struts to give the bag a frame and stop it sagging. 

### Travel Bag

This is the main bag that I haven't yet found a good solution for, it needs to be a fair size (30-40 litres) to hold enough clothes and other bit to support trips of up to a month. But at the same time it needs to be able to fasten to my wheelchair in
