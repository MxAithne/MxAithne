When travelling as a disabled person travelling with a wheelchair can be a necessity, and at times frustratingly difficult, experience but it can also be a very interesting and worthwhile experience too. When I was first disabled I went though a lot of cheap second hand wheelchairs before I purchased my day to day wheelchair, so have a fair amount of experience travelling with different types of wheelchair. So I thought that I'd share my thoughts and experiences of travelling with different types of wheelchairs.<!--more-->

*Note: I admit that I'm very lucky to have a choice about how I travel and to have a choice in which wheelchair I use, not everyone will have the ability to choose what wheelchair they use for travel. This is not meant to be a criticism of anyone who uses different wheels, just a general thinking point about how different types of wheels are suited for travel. All wheelchairs can be fine for travelling with, you just need to work with what's available to you, but if you do have a choice then this is something to think on.*

## Self Propelled Chairs

### Ridged

Personally I favour using a ridged wheelchair day to day, to me they offer so much more than folding chairs do, the main two being that they're very light weight and they don't have that annoying flexing when moving that most folding chairs seem to suffer from. They also make great travel chairs, as they're normally very light weight, which is probably the biggest plus for any independent traveller. It's also very easy to attach bags and luggage to them as they tend to be very solid. Which helps a lot with the whole travelling light thing, and means that they don't normally need any modification to carry bags without effecting their shape. With some designs of backrest on the folding chairs it's even possible to use a backpack designed for and able person on your back without attaching anything to the chair.

That being said the lack of folding ability can be limiting at times, a lot of places where you'll transfer out of your chair into a normal seat, e.g. trains and planes, will expect your wheelchair to be able to fold up, which can cause issues. It can be limiting with taxies as well, as I've had some very bad experiences with mini-cabs and getting the wheelchair loaded without it being damaged, I've had part of my chair, a Sunrise Quickie Helium<%- ncpr %>, bent by a mini-cab driver forcing his boot lid closed on it, after insisting that I couldn't put the frame on the back seat. These days I tend to always stick to accessible taxies when travelling with these wheels as while I'm lucky enough to be a part time wheelchair user and able to get out of my chair and into a 'normal' car it's not worth the hassle.

But ridged chairs make a very sensible choice for an independent traveller who spends all or most of their time on their wheels.
 
### Folding

Folding wheelchairs offer the big advantaged that they are able to fold up, this is a big plus with using transport where you would transfer out of you chair into a seat, such as trains, planes or mini-cab, they can then be folded up and stored. Their main disadvantage is that they tend to be heavier and more likely to flex than a ridged chair. The flexing can be an issue for things like putting a large backpack on the back on the chair, the back support bars will tend to bend inwards and this can make it very uncomfortable. But for me the weight is more of an issue the more my chair weighs the less I'm able to take with me as I need to be able to push myself so more weight means more effort so more energy expended.

But it's a balancing act of how much of a plus the ability to pack your chair up is over how much you can carry and how light the chair is. Folding chairs are a lot more common and so more understood by non-wheelchair users. They also tend to be slightly lower to the ground, which helps a lot when using tables as I've always found the heights of tables a bit low and legs / feet of tables get in the way of a fixed foot bar on both of my chairs.

There are some folding chairs that are closer to a ridged chair than a 'normal' folding chair, such as the Sunrise Quickie Revolution<%- ncpr %> which I use as a folding travel chair, that fold by the back rest folding on the seat and the leg supports folding upwards under the seat. This type of chair is a great compromise between a folding chair and a ridged chair with the limitation that they tend to disassemble into several parts that can make them frustrating to take apart and put back together. Also because they have a non-standard folding system people who would help you will be very unlikely to understand how to fold this type of chair up. That being said they offer the best of both worlds and do make a very good travel chair.

### A Special Note About Push Handles

To me push handles are both a great help and a massive annoyance, my disabilities mean that I have limited energy, so when I'm with friends or family it is great if they are able to help me sometimes. The problem is that strangers tend to take push handles as an invitation to help you, quite often without asking. As I'm in the position of having two wheelchairs I have both options, my day to day chair (Quickie Helium<%- ncpr %> ) does not have push handles while my folding chair (Quickie Revolution<%- ncpr %>) does have push handles (that I hacked together for it). So day to day I don't have push handles which does seem to limit the amount of people who'll try to push my chair without asking me, but does have a problem on the flip side that there are still some who'll try and end up pushing against the fabric of my chair and just pushing my body, which for me is normally very painful. I do have to always remember to tell train crew not the try and help me when using the ramps on a train as there's nothing for them to get hold of on my chair. Which can be an issue with steeper ramps as sometimes I could really do with the help. Still  there's always the option of explaining where the top of the back support bars are and to use them to push. Which is a good compromise should distance and friends / family do use this to assist me when I'm using the chair without handles.

But at the end of the day there is no right or wrong with this, it's what works best for you, I have seen other chairs with push handles that fold away or detach easily, which looks like a wonderful best of both worlds. But as neither of my chairs are fitted with these they're not something that I can comment on.

## Power Chairs

I have to admit I have very limit experience with power chairs, while I do own and use an Invacare Mirage<%- npr %> I've only travelled with it once and not had a very good experience with it. Power chairs tend to be very difficult to travel with due to their bulk and weight if you have one with sufficient range. But it is possible to travel with them, they of course add more stuff to your needs while travelling due to needing charging, but are a good option if you have limited strength and / or need to carry a lot of stuff with you.

With a power chair you're almost going the opposite way from with a self propelled chair, here you want plenty of power and range, so that means a fairly heavy chair. There also tends to be a lot of misunderstanding with non-wheelchair users over the safety of power chairs as well. I've had several bus drives and train managers express concerns about allowing a battery powered chair onto their bus / train. While this concern is completely misplaced it can be an annoying hassle to get sorted out and allowed to use something that you should not have been questioned for in the first place.

As you can see there are a lot of disadvantages to a power chair over a self propelled chair, so if it's at all possible look into a self propelled chair with power assist as the best of both worlds. Their main advantages are that they are great for people with very limited mobility and / or strength, they can carry far more than a self propelled chair and tend to be very stable. They also normally have the same performance in all weathers which self propelled chairs with customisations tend not to have.

## Summing Up

If you donâ€™t use the chair that much a folding chair is a very good option, simply for the ability to store it away, otherwise I'd personally say go with a ridged chair for travel. If at all possible go with a self propelled chair over a powered one, but if that's not an option see if power assisted works as power chairs do tend to be very difficult to travel with.
