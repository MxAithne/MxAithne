Like most backpackers wheelchair backpackers end up spending a lot of time travelling on public transport. <!--more-->

## Buses

## Coaches

## Trams & Light Rail

### London Underground

Aproxmately 25% of the London Underground network is accessible to wheelchair users, but these figures are a little massaged and include both the Docklands Light Rail and the Croydon TramLink. It is further complicated by the fact London Undergound will count a station as accessible if it is possible to get a wheelchair to the platform of one line, not onto the train, onto the platfrom. So this figure is artifically high and it is difficult to get true figure on how many London Underground stations are fully wheelchair accessible. But I would personally estimate that less than 15% of stations are fully accessible. 

## Trains

Aproxmately 50% of the UK National Rail network is accessible to wheelchair users.
