Sometimes just taking the first few steps into travelling, especially solo travelling, as a disabled person can be the most daunting thing. It can be a big and sometimes risky step into the unknown for most people, and sadly you tend to hear about the horror storied on line more than the fun stories. But there are a lot more people who've travelled solo as a disabled person than the few who talk about how bad things can be. It's all a learning curve and once you've had a few experiences everything gets so much easier.<!--more-->

*Preface: Before I became disabled I regularly travelled thousands of kilometres a month (my average was about 6000 kilometres a month) using a variety of methods. Mostly in the camper bus that I lived in, which could only realistically get me as far as the of the town or city that I was visiting. So I then would find somewhere safe to park up and get local mass transit into the town or city itself. Plus even before I was a wheelchair user I had other disabilities and had several friends who where wheelchair users. So I thought that I was more ready than most for what life as a disabled traveller was like. But the actual experience has been an eye opener.*

## Being Prepared

Research, lots of it. [To Come]

### Don't (or at least try not to) Panic

### Don't Get Angry

This is one of my long standing rants about people travelling, getting angry at or aggressive towards front line transport staff is almost never helpful. By all means tell them that you're really angry or upset about a bad situation, but shouting at or being aggressive towards them achieves nothing. The thing to remember is that while they can help you with a lot of things they have very little power in the company that they work for. The ones with the power are higher up the organisation and you almost never get to interact with them, and certainly won't when you're actually travelling. My experience is that being firm but polite with front line staff and a heavy handed letter or email to management after the fact achieves a lot more than trying to be heavy with the front line staff.

## Mass Transport

The whole mass transit system is set up to look like it's made easy for a disabled person to travel, and it can be, but it takes a lot of research to make it so. It can be very confusing at first to have to dig through different transport operators websites looking for the hard to find information about their policies on disabled people. But it'll arm you with a lot of information about how they are supposed to treat you, so once you know what they say they should be being get them to stick to it, be polite but firm about your rights to travel.

While research and trying to follow the companies that you are travelling with advice is good and should hopefully result in a smooth journey. However if you want to be more spontaneous and you're happy to be flexible, withstand a little messing around, and be firm about your rights to travel it is very possible. A good example is the UK rail network, their official stance on travelling by train with a wheelchair is that *"you should try to inform them of your journey 24 hours in advanced"*. A lot of companies will try to and turn that *you should* into a *you must*, but that's not always the case. It does mean that if they transport you're trying to use has another wheelchair user on it you'll probably have to wait for the next one, but most of the time you'll be lucky and just be able to get on and travel.

## Rest and Sleep

For me rest is another issue, I can never guarantee how fast I'm going to go though spoons, I know some things deplete spoons faster than others. But I still don't have things to the point where I know how I'm going to be for the rest of the day when I get up. If it's going to be a bad day I can normally tell, but if it's a more normal day were I will crash at some point during the day it's much harder to predict when that is going to happen. Rest is not an easy thing for me either, my Autism makes resting and relaxing in places where there are other people, even close friends / lovers, in the same room as me difficult bordering on impossible. As for resting somewhere there are strangers, well that is impossible. So that means that I pretty much have to have somewhere to go back to myself.

Sleep is a slightly different matter, if I'm sleeping I'm okay sleeping with friends / lovers in the same room. I'm even okay with strangers when I've stayed in a hostel, although settling can be a bit more difficult in that situation. But sleep only helps if it's hours, I've found that grabbing an hour or two of sleep doesn't really help me and in some cases will make me worse as I then don't have the spoons left to get up. So proper sleep helps, but power napping type sleep doesn't for me.
Another part of it is now how much I have to carry with me, there's a lot of things that can and have in the past gone horribly wrong for me. So I have a tendency to carry a lot of stuff around with me to try and cover for a lot of eventualities. I've always done this, but before they could live in the car for the less essential things, and the amount of weight in my backpack was less of an issue as I didn't have to worry about spoons as much. It can be argued that I don't need everything that I carry with me, but for the most part I actually do.

## Notes

There's a crowd sourced service called <a href="http://www.wheelmap.org/en/">Wheelmap.org</a> which is an amazing help for travelling with a wheelchair. But while it is wonderful and I highly recommend it to anyone who uses a wheelchair, nothing will beat local knowledge.
