'Our names they mean nothing they change throughtout time' (Blackmore's Night)

The name that I'm currently using for the world is Aithne Morgana. It is taken from Cornish Celtic and means Little Fire and Dweller of the Sea.

## What is my real name?

This is my 'real' name, in so much as anyone has a 'real' name, it's what I'm by in day to day life, but is not my full name. How names work to me is not quite how they work for people from other cultures, the significant difference is that my name grows as I get older. When I was born I was given a given name (the one my parents gave me) and a family name (the one the my parents share). For a while this was my full name, but as I got older I chose a new name for myself that was approperiate for the time, this was added to my name in between my given name and my family name. As my life changes I choose and use new names and each one is added into my full name, meaning that as I get older my name gets longer. There is almost no point where I will tell anyone my full name, it is long and complicated and tells the histroy of who I am. It is certianly not something that I would want to publish publically on the internet.
