On the 22nd of April 2016 I decided that for the sake of interest I would start keeping a record of all the train journeys that I've made. Origanially the idea was to keep track of the number of journeys, but over time I started tracking a bit more data. This is an evolving project and you can read more about it on the <a href="/projects/travel-stats">Travel Stats Project Page</a> but below you can see some statstics about my travel and some visualisations of those statistics.

## Visualising the data:

<div id="travel-stats-content"></div>

<script>
	$("#travel-stats-content").load("/travel-stats/embed.html")
</script>

## Notes

- This page may take a few seconds to load, that is normal because it's pulling in data from several outside sources.
- This page is broken on most small mobile devices and on tablets in portrate mode, it is a known bug and will be addressed at some point. 
	- There is a view of this data that strips out the site content that draws a little better but it is still not perfect, <a href="/travel-stats/view.html">here</a>.
