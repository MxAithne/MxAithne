Wheeled Nomad is a now defunked project of mine, it was an attempted to split off all my writings and videos about adaptive travel into their own thing so that i could do the whole social media brand thing around them. I stopped doing this in 2020 as i don't want to be building a social media brand, i still want to talk about adatptive travel, just not in isolation.
