Like many disabled people with a limited capicity tk do things i've used [spoon theory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoon_theory) to describe how well i'm doing at a given time. But i hit a wall using it with friends who knew me well, as having mental energy and physical energy combined while great for simplifing things for people who didn't know me well did not for as well for those who did. So i took a pair of terms from gaming, Action Points (AP) and Mental Points (MP), abd started to apply those, so i could better quickly describe if it was something phyical affecting me and lowering my Action Points (AP), or if it was something lowering my ability to focus on something and lowering my Mental Points.
